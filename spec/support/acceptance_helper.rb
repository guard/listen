# Used by change_fs() above so that the FS change (e.g. file created) happens
# as close to the start of a new second (time) as possible.
#
# E.g. if file is created at 1234567.999 (unix time), it's mtime on some
# filesystems is rounded, so it becomes 1234567.0, but if the change
# notification happens a little while later, e.g. at 1234568.111, now the file
# mtime and the current time in seconds are different (1234567 vs 1234568), and
# so the MD5 test won't kick in (see file.rb) - the file will not be considered
# for content checking (md5), so File.change will consider the file unmodified.
#
# This means, that if a file is added at 1234567.888 (and updated in Record),
# and then its content is modified at 1234567.999, and checking for changes
# happens at 1234568.111, the modification won't be detected.
# (because Record mtime is 1234567.0, current FS mtime from stat() is the
# same, and the checking happens in another second - 1234568).
#
# So basically, adding a file and detecting its later modification should all
# happen within 1 second (which makes testing and debugging difficult).
