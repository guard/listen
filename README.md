The Listen gem listens to file modifications and notifies you about the changes.

## WARNING

Master branch is `v2.0.0.beta` version, use the [v1.3 branch](https://github.com/guard/listen/tree/v1.3) for the stable release.

*BSD and Windows adapter are still a work in progress, any help is very welcome. Thanks!

## Features

* Supports watching multiple directories from a single listener.
* OS-specific adapters on MRI for Mac OS X 10.6+, Linux, *BSD and Windows, [more info](#listen-adapters) bellow.
* Detects file modification, addition and removal.
* Allows supplying regexp-patterns to ignore paths for better results.
* File content checksum comparison for modifications made under the same second (OS X only).
* Tested on MRI Ruby environments (1.9+ only) via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/guard/listen), JRuby and Rubinius should work with polling.

Please note that Windows and *BSD adapter aren't continuously and automaticaly tested.

## Pending features

* Non-recursive directory scanning. [#111](https://github.com/guard/listen/issues/111)
* Symlinks support. [#25](https://github.com/guard/listen/issues/25)

Pull request or help is very welcome for these.

## Changelog

The Changelog is on now on the [Github releases](https://github.com/guard/listen/releases) section.

## Install

The simplest way to install Listen is to use [Bundler](http://bundler.io).

```ruby
  gem 'listen', '~> 2.0'
```

## Usage

Call `Listen.to` with either a single directory or multiple directories, then define the "changes" callback in a block.

``` ruby
listener = Listen.to('dir/to/listen', 'dir/to/listen2') do |modified, added, removed|
  puts "modified absolute path: #{modified}"
  puts "added absolute path: #{added}"
  puts "removed absolute path: #{removed}"
end
listener.start # not blocking
sleep
```

### Pause / unpause / stop

Listener can also be easily paused/unpaused:

``` ruby
listener = Listen.to('dir/path/to/listen') { |modified, added, removed| # ... }
listener.start
listener.listen? # => true
listener.pause   # stop listening to changes
listener.paused? # => true
listener.unpause # start listening to changes again
listener.stop    # stop completely the listener
```

## Changes callback

Changes to the listened-to directories gets reported back to the user in a callback.
The registered callback gets invoked, when there are changes, with **three** parameters:
`modified`, `added` and `removed` paths, in that particular order.
Paths are always returned in their absolute form.

Example:

```ruby
listener = Listen.to('path/to/app') do |modified, added, removed|
  # This block will be called when there are changes.
end
listener.start
sleep
```

or ...

```ruby
# Create a callback
callback = Proc.new do |modified, added, removed|
  # This proc will be called when there are changes.
end
listener = Listen.to('dir', &callback)
listener.start
sleep
```

## Options

All the following options can be set through the `Listen.to` after the directory path(s) params.

```ruby
ignore: [%r{/foo/bar}, /\.pid$/, /\.coffee$/]   # Ignore a list of paths
                                                # default: See DEFAULT_IGNORED_DIRECTORIES and DEFAULT_IGNORED_EXTENSIONS in Listen::Silencer

ignore!: %r{/foo/bar}                           # Same as ignore options, but overwrite default ignored paths.

latency: 0.5                                    # Set the delay (**in seconds**) between checking for changes
                                                # default: 0.25 sec (1.0 sec for polling)

force_polling: true                             # Force the use of the polling adapter
                                                # default: none

polling_fallback_message: 'custom message'      # Set a custom polling fallback message (or disable it with false)
                                                # default: "Listen will be polling for changes. Learn more at https://github.com/guard/listen#polling-fallback."

debug: true                                     # Enable Celluloid logger
                                                # default: false
```

## Listen adapters

The Listen gem has a set of adapters to notify it when there are changes.
There are 4 OS-specific adapters to support Darwin, Linux, *BSD and Windows.
These adapters are fast as they use some system-calls to implement the notifying function.

There is also a polling adapter which is a cross-platform adapter and it will
work on any system. This adapter is slower than the rest of the adapters.

Darwin and Linux adapter are dependencies of the Listen gem so they work out of the box. For other adapters a specific gem need to be added to your Gemfile, please read bellow.

The Listen gem choose the good adapter (if present) automatically. If you
want to force the use of the polling adapter use the `:force_polling` option
while initializing the listener.

### On Windows

If your are on Windows you can try to use the [`wdm`](https://github.com/Maher4Ever/wdm) instead of polling.
Please add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
require 'rbconfig'
gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0' if RbConfig::CONFIG['target_os'] =~ /mswin|mingw|cygwin/i
```

### On *BSD

If your are on *BSD you can try to use the [`rb-kqueue`](https://github.com/mat813/rb-kqueue) instead of polling.
Please add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
require 'rbconfig'
gem 'rb-kqueue', '>= 0.2' if RbConfig::CONFIG['target_os'] =~ /freebsd/i
```

### Issues

Sometimes OS-specific adapter doesn't work, :'(
Here are some things you could try to avoid forcing polling.

* [Update your Dropbox client](http://www.dropbox.com/downloading) (if used).
* Move or rename the listened folder.
* Update/reboot your OS.
* Increase latency.

If your application keeps using the polling-adapter and you can't figure out why, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/guard/listen/issues/new) (and be sure to [give all the details](https://github.com/guard/listen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
